Register a Study Interactively
==============================

Submission of data into ENA requires a study to contain and manage it.
Studies (also referred to as projects) can be registered through the
`Webin Submissions Portal<../general-guide/interactive.html>`_.
Log in with your Webin credentials and select the 'Register Study' button to bring up the below interface:

This form is used to register a study (also referred to as a project). Studies are typically registered before any data is submitted.
Data can be added to the study at any time. Please see `Interactive Submission Options <../general-guide/interactive.html>`_ to learn how to access it. Fill it out and click 'Submit' to register your study and receive accession numbers.
The details can be edited and updated later, but you need to have registered a study to submit your data.




Locus Tag Prefixes
==================

If you intend to submit an annotated genome assembly, you will need to register
a locus tag prefix at this stage. In the bottom right of the form, find the
question about functional genome annotation and check the 'Yes' radio button and
enter your prefix into the box which appears. Once you submit this, it will take
24 hours for the prefix to be usable.

The prefix you enter must conform to the following rules:
 - Starts with a letter
 - Between 3 and 12 characters long
 - Is upper case
 - Contains only alpha-numeric characters and no symbols such as -_*
