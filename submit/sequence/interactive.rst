Submit Annotated Sequences Interactively
========================================

| Submitting a new annotated sequence entry can be done interactively through Webin.
  Ensure you `register a study <../study.html>`_ before you begin if you have not already done so.
| Interactive submission of annotated sequences requires you to select a checklist and fill out a spreadsheet of information about your sequence.
  Please view the available `Annotation Checklists <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/annotation-checklists>`_ and pick out a suitable one in advance.
  If there is no appropriate checklist available, you will need to create a flatfile and use a different submission method.
| Two methods are described here: spreadsheet based and non-spreadsheet based.
  Submitting via spreadsheet is recommended, especially if you have many sequences to submit.


Submitting Via Spreadsheet
==========================

| To begin, visit the `sequence checklist portal <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/webin/sequence-checklist>`_.
| Here, you can review the available checklists, select the most appropriate, customise it, and review the allowed values for each field.
  Download your chosen spreadsheet and fill it out according to the restrictions given in the checklist portal.
  You should not edit any of the filled cells of the spreadsheet you download, only modify the empty ones by inserting your data and metadata.

| To submit, `log in to your Webin account <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/sra/#home>`_, navigate to the 'New Submission' tab and select 'Submit other assembled and annotated sequences'.
| On the next screen, select the study you wish to submit to (or use the 'Create a new study' link).
| On the following screen, note the 'Submit Completed Spreadsheet' button.
  You should use this to upload your selected checklist.
  If there are errors with your spreadsheet, you will be informed: correct them and redo the submission.

| Once the submission is accepted, you will be shown a confirmation screen with a tracking number resembling ERZxxxxxx.
  You will later receive an email with your accession numbers.


Non-Spreadsheet Submission
==========================

| Submitting without a spreadsheet can be convenient if you have a small number of sequences (<3) to submit.


Step 1: Select and Customise a Checklist
----------------------------------------

| To begin, `log in to your Webin account <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/sra/#home>`_, navigate to the 'New Submission' tab and select 'Submit other assembled and annotated sequences'.
| On the next screen, select the study you wish to submit to (or use the 'Create a new study' link).
| Next, you can start building your submission by clicking 'Select Checklist'.
| Browse the list of available checklists.
  A description is available for each one.

| You can select extra fields to add to your spreadsheet at this point.
  These extra fields give your data more context and help other users understand it.

Step 2: Fill Out Shared Details
----------------------------------------

| In this next screen, you should fill out details which are shared by all of your sequences.
  This information will be used to populate the form for each sequence you add to this submission.
| None of these fields are mandatory at this stage, and you will be able to edit their content on an individual basis later.

Step 3: Fill Out Individual Details
-----------------------------------

In this final step, you should fill out the details for each sequence individually.
Depending on how you completed the previous step, some fields will be filled already.

Use the '+Add' button to increase the amount of sequences, using the adjacent field to specify how many sequences to add.
In the box below, you can move between different sequences using the checks on the left.
On the right, a green tick indicates a sequence with all mandatory fields completed, while a red exclamation mark indicates errors to be resolved.
The red 'X' can be used to remove an entry completely.

Next to each field, you can mouse over the blue 'i' to learn more about what should be entered.


Step 4: Submit Your Sequences
-----------------------------

When you have entered all the information you wish to and all of the sequences show green ticks indicating that they are correctly filled out, click 'Submit' to have your submission validated.
If your sequences fail validation, you will be informed of this here.
Otherwise, if your submission is successful, a confirmation page will appear and you will later receive an email with your accession numbers.
