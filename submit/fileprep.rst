Preparing Files for Submission
==============================

All files that are submitted to ENA need to be in the appropriate format to be accepted.

In the case of any data submitted `Interactively <general-guide/interactive.html>`_ or 
`Programmatically <general-guide/programmatic.html>`_ you will also need to register the 
md5 checksum of your files and upload these to your Webin Upload Area prior to submission. 

If data is submitted using `Webin-CLI <general-guide/webin-cli.html>`_ there is no need 
to register md5 checksums or previously upload data as the tool will do all this for you 
at the time of submission.
