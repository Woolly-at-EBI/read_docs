How to Submit Assemblies
========================

Introduction
============

To submit genome or transcriptome assemblies to ENA you must also provide some metadata to 
describe your research project. This helps make your data re-useable and searchable.

Within ENA, all assemblies are submitted as 'analysis' submission objects but are processed 
differently depending on what type of assembly is submitted.

If you are not yet familiar with the metadata model, please see 
`here <general-guide/metadata.html>`_ for some more information.

As an assembly references ENA sample and study objects, you must submit these before you
submit your data. It is also strongly recommended to submit as well as reference any reads associated with the assembly being submitted.

See below for information on how to: register a study within ENA to describe your overall research project,
register samples with information on the biological data that was sequenced then assembled and submit any reads associated with each sample being submitted.
   
- `Register a study <study.html>`_
- `Register a sample <samples.html>`_
- `Submit raw reads <reads.html>`_

Accessions
==========

As all assemblies in ENA are submitted as 'analyses', for each assembly submission, Webin will report 
a unique accession number that starts with ERZ. For most assemblies, this accession number is for 
internal processing only and will not be visible in the browser. As a result, for most 
assemblies you will recieve additional post-processing accession numbers starting with GCA\_. 

Please see individual submission guidelines for information on what accessions you will receive for 
each assembly type.

Always make a note of any accessions you receive as these are the unique identifiers for each of 
your submissions to ENA.

The ERZ accession can be used to access information on the progress of the internal processing of 
each assembly through the `Webin Submissions Portal <general-guide/submissions-portal.html>`_ or 
`Webin Reports Service <general-guide/reports-service.html>`_.

Submission Options
==================

Genome and transcriptome assemblies can only be submitted using the 
Webin-CLI submission interface. For an overview of how to use this, please 
see the documentation on `Webin-CLI Submission <general-guide/webin-cli.html>`_.
