# Webin-CLI Submission

## Introduction

Submissions to ENA can be made using the interactive Webin submission service, programmatic Webin submission
service and the Webin command line submission service.

This module gives an introduction to the Webin command line submission interface
used to validate, upload and submit files to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA).
Please note that unlike with other ENA submissions routes you may have used, you
do not need to pre-upload your files when using Webin-CLI.

Webin-CLI is the only way to submit assembled genomes and transcriptomes.

## Download the Program

The latest version of the Webin command line submission interface can be downloaded from:

<https://github.com/enasequence/webin-cli/releases>

The program requires Java 1.8 or newer which can be downloaded from:

<https://java.com/en/download/>

We have tested Webin-CLI against Oracle Java 8 Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.8.0_202.

We recommend that all submitters use this version.

Latest oracle JREs can be downloaded from here:

<https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html>

Older oracle JREs can be downloaded from here:

<https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase8-2177648.html>

## Using the Program

The  Webin command line submission interface is a self-executing Java jar file and is
run using the `java` command:

`java -jar webin-cli-<version>.jar <options>`

for example:

`java -jar webin-cli-1.7.3.jar <options>`

The `<version>` is the version number of the program.

Please note that the command must include the location of the jar file. For example, if 
you have it in your Downloads directory, the appropriate command on Mac/Linux on 
immediately opening the terminal would be:

`java -jar Downloads/webin-cli-1.7.3.jar <options>`

On Windows a backward slash is used instead of a forward slash:

`java -jar Downloads\webin-cli-1.7.3.jar <options>`

The command line `<options>` are explained below.

## Command Line Options

- `-context`: the   submission type:
    - `-context genome`
    - `-context transcriptome`
    - `-context sequence`
    - `-context reads`
- `-userName`: the Webin submission account name.
- `-password`: the Webin submission account password.
- `-centerName`: the center name of the submitter (mandatory for broker accounts).
- `-manifest`: the manifest file name.
- `-outputDir`: directory for output files.
- `-inputDir`: input directory for files declared in manifest file.
- `-validate`: validates the files defined in the manifest file.
- `-submit`: validates and submits the files defined in the manifest file.
- `-test`: use Webin test service instead of the production service. Please note that the
Webin upload area is shared between test and production services, and that test submission
files will not be archived.
- `-ascp`: use Aspera Cli instead of FTP file transfer, if available. Aspera Cli
should be installed and path to executable "ascp" should be in PATH variable.
- `-version`: prints the version number of the program and exists.
- `-help`: detailed information about the different options.

## Submission Process

The following types of submissions are supported:

- genome assemblies
- transcriptome assemblies
- annotated sequences
- reads

The type of the submission is specified using the `-context` command line option:
- `-context genome`
- `-context transcriptome`
- `-context sequence`
- `-context reads`    

The following picture illustrates the stages of the submission process:

![Submission process](../images/webin-cli_01.png)

## Stage 1: Pre-register Study and Sample

Each submission must be associated with a pre-registered study and a sample.

- [Register a Study](../study.html)
- [Register a Sample](../samples.html)


## Stage 2: Prepare the Files

The set of files that are part of the submission must be specified using a manifest file.
The manifest file is specified using the `-manifest <filename>` option.

### Manifest File Format

The manifest file has two columns separated by a tab (or any whitespace characters):
- Field name (first column): case insensitive field name   
- Field value (second column): field value

The manifest file contains metadata fields and file name fields.

Examples of metadata fields are study and sample references:

```
STUDY   Study accession or unique name (alias)
SAMPLE   Sample accession or unique name (alias)
ANALYSIS_REF Comma separated list of analysis accession(s) 
RUN_REF Comma separated list of run accession(s)  
```

The file name field format is:

```
<file type>  <file name>
```

An example of a file name field is:

```
FASTA   genome.fasta.gz
```

For example, the following manifest file represents a genome assembly consisting of contigs
provided in one fasta file:

```
STUDY   TODO
SAMPLE   TODO
ASSEMBLYNAME   TODO
COVERAGE   TODO
PROGRAM   TODO
PLATFORM   TODO
MINGAPLENGTH   TODO
MOLECULETYPE   genomic DNA
FASTA   genome.fasta.gz
```

### Manifest File Types

Please refer to the more detailed documentation for supported file types for each submission.

Sequence based submission support the following formats:

- FASTA: Sequences in fasta format
- FLATFILE: Sequences in EMBL-Bank flat file format

The following additional formats are supported for [genome assembly submissions](../assembly/webin-cli.html):

- AGP: Sequences in [AGP format](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/agp/AGP_Specification/)
- CHROMOSOME_LIST: list of chromosomes
- UNLOCALISED_LIST: list of unlocalised sequences

The following formats are supported for [read submissions](../reads/webin-cli.html):

- BAM: BAM file
- CRAM: CRAM file
- FASTQ: fastq file

#### Info File (for backward compability only)

You can also provide the metadata fields in a separate info file. The info file has the same format as the manifest file.

When a separate info file is used then the manifest file must contain the `INFO`
field pointing to the info file.

For example, the following manifest file represents a genome assembly consisting of contigs
provided in one fasta file:

```
INFO   assembly.info
FASTA   genome.fasta.gz
```

## Stage 3: Validate and Submit Files

You can validate your files using the `-validate` command line option. Note that
the `-submit` option must be used to submit the validated files.

You can submit your files using the `-submit` command line option. Before
being submitted your files will be validated and uploaded to your
private Webin file upload area in webin.ebi.ac.uk.

Please refer to individual modules for validation rules.

Validation error reports are written into the `<outputDir>/<context>/<name>/validate` directory.

The webin command line submission interface creates and submits XMLs for you. These XMLs and
the Receipt XML containing accession numbers are written into the `<outputDir>/<context>/<name>/submit`
directory. This directory also contains the file manifest that refers to the files that are
part of the submission.

The `<outputDir>` can be specified using the `-outputDir` option, the `<context>` is
specified using the `-context` option, and the `<name>` is a submitter provided unique
name specified in the `manifest` file.

Once the submission is complete an accession number is immediately returned to the
submitter by the Webin command line submission interface. Please refer to individual modules for advice which
long term stable accession numbers can be used in publications.

## Output Directory Structure

An output directory can be specific to the Webin command line submission interface
using the `-outputDir` option. This directory will have the following subdirectories:
- `<context>/<name>/validate`
- `<context>/<name>/submit`

If the `-outputDir` option is not specified then the directory in which the
`-manifest` file is used as the output directory.  

The `<context>` is the submission type provided using the `-context` option
and the `<name>` is the unique name provided in the manifest file.

- The `validate` directory contains the validation reports created using the `-validate` option.
- The `submit` directory contains the XMLs created by the `-submit` option including the
Receipt XML. This directory also contains the file manifest that refers to the files that are
part of the submission.

## Validation Reports

If the `-validate` action fails for any reason then validation reports are written into directory:

`<context>/<name>/validate`

The validation reports correspond to the input files with an added suffix `.report`.

For example, a validated fasta file `assembly.fasta` will have a corresponding validation
report `assembly.fasta.report`.

Messages which can't be attributed to a specific input file will be written to both standard out and
in the following file:  

`<context>/<name>/validate/webin-cli.report`

## Proxy Servers

If your organisation uses a https proxy you can set the following Java properties to instruct
the webin-cli to use them:

- https.proxyHost
- https.proxyPort

For example:

```
java -Dhttps.proxyHost=proxy.com -Dhttps.proxyPort=8080 -jar webin-cli-<version>.jar <options>
```

Similarly, if your organisation uses a ftp proxy you can set the following properties:

- ftp.proxyHost
- ftp.proxyPort

For example:

```
java -Dftp.proxyHost=proxy.com -Dftp.proxyPort=8080 -jar webin-cli-<version>.jar <options>
```

### Using Aspera Instead of FTP to Upload Files

By default the Webin command line interface will use FTP to upload files to the
webin.ebi.ac.uk server. Alternatively, you may use the Aspera protocol by installing
[Aspera Cli](https://downloads.asperasoft.com/en/downloads/62) and specifying the
`-ascp` option.

Please note that that the folder containing the `ascp` command line program
must be included in the PATH variable. The `ascp` command can be found from
the `cli/bin` directory of the downloaded and expanded Aspera Cli archive file.

## Release policy

- Webin-CLI uses standard three number semantic versioning.
- Patch releases: the third digit is incremented by one after backward compatible bug fixes. For example, from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2.
- Minor releases: the second digit is incremented by one after backward compatible new features. For example, from 1.0.1 to 1.1.0.
- Major releases: changes that break backward compatibility result in the first digit being incremented. For example, from 1.0.1 to 2.0.0.
- The definition of Webin-CLI backward compatibility is that there are no breaking changes to the command line usage or to the file formats.
- All releases are made immediately after bugs have been fixed or new features have been added.
- Releases are downloadable from: https://github.com/enasequence/webin-cli/releases.
- After all releases, we will endeavour to contact affected submitters who previously were unable to complete their submissions.
- Minor and Major releases will be announced to ena-announce@ebi.ac.uk mailing list.
- After Minor or Major releases, submitters will be asked to migrate to use this (or higher) version after a transition period.
- After a Minor release, we will give two weeks notice for submitters to migrate to the new (or higher) version.
- After a Major release, we will give at least two months notice for submitters to migrate to the new (or higher) version.
