Register a Submission Account
=============================

Before you can submit data to ENA you must register a Webin submission account.

To do so, please navigate to the `Webin Submissions Portal (WSP) <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/webin/login>`_ and
click the 'Register' button.
You will be presented with the below interface:

Fill out the boxes, giving details of the group and centre for which you are submitting.
Note that the 'Center Name' value will be applied irrevocably to all submissions you make from this account.
Always make sure this value is correct before you perform a submission, as it cannot be updated later.

You must add at least one contact to the account.
Names added here will be automatically included in certain types of submission, including those which are processed into
the EMBL Flat File format.
In addition, when contacting the helpdesk certain requests will only be considered from people named as account
contacts.
It is therefore advisable to add new members of your team to this account if they are likely to participate in
submission activities.
