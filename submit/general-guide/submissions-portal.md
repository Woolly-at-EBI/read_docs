# Webin Submissions Portal

Webin submissions portal is a simple interactive web interface which supports:

* Submission of XML metadata objects
* Update of XML metadata objects
* Reports from the [Webin reports service](/reports-service.html)
* Download of spreadsheet template for annotated sequences

## Service URL

Production service URL:

<https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/webin/>

Test service URL:

<https://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/webin/>

## Authentication

Please use your Webin submission account credentials to login into the service.

## Submit XMLs

Once you have logged in you can use the default page to submit XMLs to Webin.

In the example below, one or more studies are being submitted using a project XML (`project.xml`) and a
submission XML (`sub.xml`). The project XML contains the study details while the submission XML
defines the submission actions.

![Webin submissions portal](../images/webin_portal_study.png)

To submit, simply browse to the `project.xml` and `sub.xml` files and click submit.

You can see the receipt in the browser window either in a tabular format:

or you can look at the receipt XML:

## Reports

### Studies

The `Studies` report lists all studies submitted through your
submission account.

![Webin submissions portal](../images/webin_portal_studies.png)

The `Release date` shows when the study and any associated data
will be made public. If the `Release date` is in the future
then the `Status` will be `Private`. The status will become `Public`
once the the study release date expires.

In the above example, the status of the study is `Cancelled`. This
means that that study has been withdrawn before making it public.
Studies that are withdrawn after they have become public have
either `Suppressed` or `Killed` status.

### Samples

The `Samples` report lists all samples submitted through your
submission account.

![Webin submissions portal](../images/webin_portal_samples.png)

Like studies all samples have a `Status`. Note that samples
are automatically made public when data referring to them
is made public.

### Runs

The `Runs` report lists all sequence read experiments submitted through your
submission account.

![Webin submissions portal](../images/webin_portal_runs.png)

Sequence read experiments are defined using run and experiment metadata
objects. Data files are associated with runs while experiments
link runs to studies and samples.

Run and experiment are automatically made public when
the study they are part of is made public.

### Analyses

The `Analyses` report lists all analyses submitted through your
submission account.

![Webin submissions portal](../images/webin_portal_analyses.png)

Analyses can be of many different types. Many analyses are automatically made
public when the study they are part of is made public. Some analyses
will always be kept private while their data is made available
through other services.

### Run Files

The `Run files` report lists all run files submitted through your
submission account.

![Webin submissions portal](../images/webin_portal_run_files.png)

The `Archive status` column value becomes `File archived`
once the file has been incorporated into the archive. Any pre-archival
file validation errors are also shown in this column.

### Analysis Files

The `Analysis files` report lists all analysis files submitted through your
submission account.

![Webin submissions portal](../images/webin_portal_analysis_files.png)

The `Archive status` column value becomes `File archived`
once the file has been incorporated into the archive. Any pre-archival
file validation errors are also shown in this column.

### Run Process

The `Run process` report lists the processing status of runs submitted through your
submission account.  

![Webin submissions portal](../images/webin_portal_run_process.png)

When the `Process status` is `COMPLETED` then the run has
been successfully processed by the archive. Note that submitted
files may be archived and available for download without them
being succesfully processed. In this case derived file
products, such as archive generated Fastq files, may
be missing.

### Analysis process

The `Analysis process` report lists the processing status of analyses submitted through your
submission account.  

![Webin submissions portal](../images/webin_portal_analysis_process.png)

When the `Process status` is `COMPLETED` then the analysis has
been successfully processed by the archive. In the above example, the status of the
analysis is `CANCELLED`. This means that that analysis processing has been
cancelled and will no longer be attempted.

If any sequence accessions are assigned as part of the analysis processing
then they will be listed in the `Sequence accession` column.

### Unsubmitted files

Uploading a file to the Webin file upload area is not sufficient for inclusion into the archive.
The file must also be submitted through the Webin submission service either as a run or analysis.

The Webin file upload area is a temporary transit area. Any unsubmitted files are subject
to be removed according to [ENA fair use policy](../fileprep/upload.html).

The unsubmitted file report shows uploaded files scheduled to be removed unless
submitted by the expiration date.
