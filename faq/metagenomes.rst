Metagenome Submission Queries
=============================

Metagenomic studies involve assembling sequencing data sampled from an entire biome all the way down to the individual species that were living in that environment. As a result, there are often many queries regarding how these assemblies are submitted in order to make the quality of the assembly and original source of data as clear as possible.

The following image illustrates the stages of a metagenome assembly study and what is submittable to each of the metagenome assembly levels in ENA:

Please see `here <..submit/assembly/metagenome.html>`_ for more information on how to submit your metagenome assemblies to ENA.

What is defined as a MAG within ENA?
====================================

Within ENA, a MAG is described as a single-taxon assembly based on one or more binned metagenomes asserted to be a close representation to an actual individual genome (that could match an already existing isolate or represent a novel isolate).

There should only be one MAG submitted for each species within a biome. This can be determined using a de-replication step or by choosing the highest quality representative genome for each predicted species.

MAG assemblies are registered within ENA in the same domain as cultured isolate genome assemblies which means that these genome assemblies are searchable alongside cultured isolates and are used by the same downstream processes. As an environmental sample can contain many duplicate genomes of the same organism and as MAG assemblies are more prone to contamination, we request only the highest quality unique-taxon submissions are submitted as MAGs. This means only the highest quality sequences and most accurate annotated features are used within these downstream services to keep them as relevant and informative as possible.

How is the quality of a metagenomic assembly defined?
=====================================================

When binned and MAG samples are registered with ENA, three quality measures are recorded which together determine the overall quality of a metagenome derived assembly. These three measures follow the data standards defined by the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC) in the 2018 publication `here <https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3893>`_.

The three attributes in the sample checklists that contribute to the overall quality are as follows:

1. **Assembly Quality** - a written description of the quality of an assembly (one of a choice of 3 options).
2. **Completeness Score** - the ratio of observed single-copy marker genes to total single-copy marker genes in chosen marker gene set (%).
3. **Contamination Score** - the ratio of observed single-copy marker genes in ≥2 copies to total single-copy marker genes in chosen marker gene set (%).

It is essential you complete these fields accurately so that the overall quality of an assembly is searchable within ENA. If you wish to search for binned metagenomes or MAGs by overall quality, the thresholds for these standards are outlined below.

**Finished Assembly**

Any assembly where the assembly quality is defined as: "Single contiguous sequence without gaps or ambiguities with a consensus error rate equivalent to Q50 or better".

**High-quality draft**

It is useful to bear in mind these quality thresholds when assembling and submitting metagenomic assemblies.

How do I navigate through a metagenomics study?
===============================================

When submitting metagenomic samples it is important to enter the “sample derived from” field correctly.

This field is used to correctly trace back your data through the assembly stages to its environmental biome-level origin. Users viewing the data can then also utilise the “sample derived from” attribute to navigate through the assemblies making your methods clear and reproducible.

It is important to note that you can access all the assembly layers from the study itself. However, these assemblies do not associate with each other. To look for associated metadata for these assemblies and which assemblies are derived from which, you should refer to the samples.

How do I register samples for co-assemblies?
============================================

When registering co-assemblies, you should reference multiple samples (or reads) in the “sample derived from” field. These can be formatted as one of the following:

**A comma separated list**:

This should not contain spaces.

e.g.  formatted as

ERSxxxxxx,ERSxxxxxx

or

ERRxxxxxx,ERRxxxxxx

**A range**:

This should be in the case where the assembly was derived from many samples and should be formatted with a ‘-‘ character between two accession without any spaces. The accession format should be consistent within the range and all accessions referenced within the range should have been used in that assembly.

e.g. formatted as

ERSxxxxxx-ERSxxxxxx

or

ERRxxxxxx-ERRxxxxxx

If you wish to submit a primary assembly which is co-assembled from raw reads, please inform our `helpdesk <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/support>`_.


How do I submit uncultured virus genomes (UViGs)?
=================================================

The method used for submission of uncultured virus genomes depends on the methods used to identify these genomes.

If the virus genome was derived from a study where the entire biome of environmental data was sequenced together and then binned by taxonomy, then please submit with the same methods as those outlined in the `metagenome assembly <../submit/assembly/metagenome.html>`_ submission guidelines. This is with the exception of the use of the **GSC MIMAGS** checklist. For virus genomes, the `GSC MIUVIGS <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERC000049>`_ checklist should be utilised for each virus assembly.

If the virus genome was derived from a study using single-cell amplification techniques, then please submit with the same methods as those outlined in the `environmental single-cell amplified genome assembly <../submit/assembly/environmental-sag.html>`_ submission guidelines. This is with the exception of the use of the **GSC MISAGS** checklist. For virus genomes, the `GSC MIUVIGS <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERC000049>`_ checklist should be utilised for each virus assembly.

How do I submit metagenome assemblies without raw data or primary assemblies to point to?
=========================================================================================

It is recommended to submit all levels of metagenomic assembly where possible. However, there are exceptions where this can not be done. For example, if you have assembled bacteria from a metagenome derived from a human host, your raw data may be contaminated with human DNA which you do not have the permission to make publicly available.

In cases where it is not possible to provide raw data or a primary metagenome, environmental samples should still be registered. However, as the registered **environmental** samples do not have any data associated with them, they need to be manually released to become available to the public.

If you have not submitted raw reads or primary assemblies, sample release can be done in advance of your study release without the risk of any data files being prematurely released. However, if you do not wish to have your sample *metadata* publicly available before your study is released, this option is not suitable and it is recommended to make a note of the Study release date and release these samples during the same time of the study release.

To manually release your environmental samples, first you need to prepare a submission XML file containing all your **environmental** sample accessions in a block of ACTION tags.

An example of a submission XML for the release of three environmental samples is below:

.. code-block:: xml

    <SUBMISSION>
        <ACTIONS>
             <ACTION>
                  <RELEASE target="ERS3334823"/>
             </ACTION>
             <ACTION>
                  <RELEASE target="ERS3334824"/>
             </ACTION>
             <ACTION>
                  <RELEASE target="ERS3334825"/>
             </ACTION>
        </ACTIONS>
    </SUBMISSION>

These samples can then be released programmatically through the secure HTTPS protocol using a tool such as curl.

Below is an example of a environmental sample release command:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -u username:password -F "SUBMISSION=@submission.xml" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/drop-box/submit/"

If your release is successful you should receive a receipt like the one below:

.. code-block:: xml

    <RECEIPT receiptDate="2019-03-25T08:23:45.795Z" submissionFile="submission.xml" success="true">
         <MESSAGES>

              <INFO>sample accession "ERS3334824" is set to public status.</INFO>
              <INFO>sample accession "ERS3334825" is set to public status.</INFO>
              <INFO>Submission has been committed.</INFO>
