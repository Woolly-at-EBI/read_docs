Members of the user community produce software to assist in the preparation 
and submission of files to ENA. Some go on to make these more widely available 
to other users.

The following are tools which are openly available. Please note that we are not
responsible for the creation or maintenance of these tools and if you have 
queries about their use you should contact the creators directly. While we had 
no hand in their production and have not thoroughly reviewed them, we have 
heard from users of them that they have been valuable. 


`EMBLmyGFF3 <https://github.com/NBISweden/EMBLmyGFF3>`_ is a creation of 
staff at NBI Sweden. This tool can be used to convert an assembly in FASTA
format along with associated annotation in GFF3 format into the EMBL flat file
format which is the required format for submitting annotated assemblies to us.
