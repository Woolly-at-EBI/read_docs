Programmatically Accessing Taxonomic Information
================================================

Every ENA sample object should have a taxonomic classification. The INSDC maintains a database of all unique
taxonomic classifications known to us. Each classification has a unique id and this is expanded to show the scientific
name and common name of the organism when the sample is viewed in the
`ENA Browser <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/Taxon:9606>`_.

There are several ways that you can access information about taxonomy or related records using the REST APIs available
through the ENA taxonomy services.

Finding General Information about Taxa
======================================

If you know the scientific name of the organism you can find the tax ID with this endpoint:

.. code-block:: bash

   www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/taxonomy/rest/scientific-name/

Simply append the scientific name to the URL:

.. code-block:: bash

   > curl "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/taxonomy/rest/scientific-name/Leptonycteris%20nivalis"
   [
     {
       "taxId": "59456",
       "scientificName": "Leptonycteris nivalis",
       "commonName": "Mexican long-nosed bat",
       "formalName": "true",
       "rank": "species",
       "division": "MAM",
       "lineage": "Eukaryota; Metazoa; Chordata; Craniata; Vertebrata; Euteleostomi; Mammalia; Eutheria; Laurasiatheria; Chiroptera; Microchiroptera; Phyllostomidae; Glossophaginae; Leptonycteris; ",
       "geneticCode": "1",
       "mitochondrialGeneticCode": "2",
       "submittable": "true"
     }
   ]

You can also do this with the common name using this endpoint:

.. code-block:: bash

   www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/taxonomy/rest/any-name/

Simply append the common name to the URL:

.. code-block:: bash

   > curl "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/taxonomy/rest/any-name/golden%20arrow%20poison%20frog"
   [
     {
       "taxId": "377316",
       "scientificName": "Atelopus zeteki",
       "commonName": "golden arrow poison frog",
       "formalName": "true",
       "rank": "species",
       "division": "VRT",
       "lineage": "Eukaryota; Metazoa; Chordata; Craniata; Vertebrata; Euteleostomi; Amphibia; Batrachia; Anura; Neobatrachia; Hyloidea; Bufonidae; Atelopus; ",
       "geneticCode": "1",
       "mitochondrialGeneticCode": "2",
       "submittable": "true"
     }
   ]

Please note that not all taxa have a common name.

If you do not know the scientific name or the common name but you have an idea, you can use the *suggest* endpoint:

.. code-block:: bash

   www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/taxonomy/rest/suggest-for-submission/

See this example using the search term "curry":

.. code-block:: bash

   > curl "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/taxonomy/rest/suggest-for-submission/curry"
   [
     {
       "taxId": "159030",
       "scientificName": "Murraya koenigii",
       "displayName": "curry leaf"
     },
     {
       "taxId": "261786",
       "scientificName": "Helichrysum italicum",
       "displayName": "curry plant"
     }
   ]

Accessing Taxon XML Records and Full Lineage
============================================

You can access the XML record of any public taxon using the `Browser API <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/api/>`_.
For example, to access the record of the
`ant fungus garden metagenome <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/Taxon:797283>`_ taxon, we can provide the Browser
API XML endpoint with the tax ID **797283**.

.. code-block:: bash

   https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/api/xml/797283

You can also choose to download this directly from the API by specifying "download=true":

.. code-block:: bash

   https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/api/xml/797283?download=true

This XML record provides general taxonomic information such as rank or translation genetic code as well as the
scientific names and tax IDs of the parent and child taxa related to the record. This allows full exploration of the
lineage of the taxon.

Finding Associated Records
==========================

For a report of all records associated with a taxon, you can use the
`Discovery Portal API <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/>`_. This API can provide a table of record counts as
well as provide a list of record IDs and descriptions when provided a 'result' data type.

For example, to provide a report of all records that link to the 'ant fungus garden metagenome' taxon, we could
provide the Portal API with the tax ID using the 'links/taxon' endpoint. This can be in tsv or json format:

.. code-block:: bash

   https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/links/taxon?accession=797283&format=tsv

**Result:**

.. code-block::

   result_id	description	entry_cnt	base_cnt	subtree_entry_cnt	subtree_base_cnt

   coding_release	Coding (Release)	4	144	4	144
   noncoding_update	Non-coding (Update)	0	0	0	0


From this summary, we can see that this taxon has 15 studies associated with it. To then see a report of the study IDs
and descriptions, we can specify this with the addition of 'result=study':

.. code-block:: bash

   https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/links/taxon?accession=797283&format=tsv&result=study

**Result:**

.. code-block:: bash

   study_accession	description

   PRJNA336974	Cyphomyrmex longiscapus fungus garden microbial communities from Gamboa, Panama metagenome

   PRJNA62039	Atta cephalotes Fungus Garden Metagenome
   PRJNA62041	Atta colombica Fungus Garden Top Metagenome
   PRJNA62043	Atta colombica Fungus Garden Bottom Metagenome

When exploring links to taxon records, you can also specify a taxonomic node such as a genus or family rank taxon
and request all links in that subtree. For example, if you would like a report of all studies associated with taxa
that are under the tax node `ecological metagenomes <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/Taxon:410657>`_. You
could specify this with the addition of "subtree=true":

.. code-block:: bash

   https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/links/taxon?accession=410657&result=study&subtree=true

Downloading Taxonomy Data via FTP

GBIF and the Darwin Core Archive
--------------------------------

The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) aims to make the worldâ€™s Biodiversity data freely
and universally available to provide an essential global informatics infrastructure for Biodiversity research and
applications worldwide. Read about the Darwin Core Standard (DwC) on their website
`here <https://www.gbif.org/darwin-core>`_.

The Darwin Core Archive comprises of 3 files: a tab-delimited data file, an XML file listing the descriptors
of used in the data file and an another XML file representing a metadata file with information related to the
data itself, the data supplier, the archive creator name of the person who created the archive.
