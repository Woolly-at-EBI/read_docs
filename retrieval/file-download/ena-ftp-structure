ENA FTP Structure
=================

The root of the ENA FTP server is at:

::

    ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ena/


This server contains short pieces of assembled/annotated sequence dating back
to the early 80s, as well as more modern data types including genome
assemblies, metagenome assemblies, and transcriptome sequence assemblies.
This server does not contain other data types such as raw reads, which can be
found in the `SRA FTP server <../sra-ftp-structure.html>`_.

It is expected that users will find relevant data through the various search
interfaces available from ENA, rather than directly interacting with and
navigating the FTP server.
This page therefore does not provide an exhaustive explanation of the server's
structure, but serves to briefly describe what you will find in some of its
most important subdirectories.

For some, but not all categories, suppressed data is kept separate from public.

Most data is available in `EMBL flat file format
<https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/fileprep/flat-file-example.html>`_,
with some also available as FASTA.
