How to Perform a Search Across ENA Based on Taxonomy
====================================================

To perform a search for taxa, please go to the `Advanced Search UI <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/advanced-search>`_
and select 'Taxonomic Classification' in the **Data type** dropdown. Click Next.

Click on the filter group Taxonomy and related.

In the Query builder Select filter dropdown, select NCBI Taxonomy. In the text field start typing in the taxon of
interest. A list of suggestions will pop up so that you can select the one you want.

If you wish to search taxa over a lineage of the taxonomic tree, please tick the “Include subordinate taxa” box.

Further customise your search using the Next button, or hit Search. In the results view you can click on the taxon
ID to view the record.

The view page for every taxon record contains a *Related ENA Records* display.  This provides access to all public ENA
data that are classified as belonging to the taxa being viewed, or to the full taxonomic subtree starting from the
node in question.  With the portal table, the number of objects are listed and these are linked to search result-like
listings of all data that can be browsed, viewed or downloaded.
